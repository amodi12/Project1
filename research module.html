    This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:

    <ul>
        <li> Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis </li>
        <li> Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel </li>
        <li> Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW </li>
    </ul>

<h2>
    Fromat data for analysis
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oFic8Mh2MLJrcKeostXoGZ7XIltF6Dzg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109876401908449545199&rtpof=true&sd=true">ToolBox.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
In the Raw Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.

</p>
<ol>
    <li> Each variable name must be different from other varibale name</li>
    <li> The first varibale in column A is a unique identifier</li>
    <li> The varibale name must start with a letter (not number or special character) so the change <i> 4tutorial_types to tutorial_types.
     </i> </li>
    <li> Name the varibale so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change use and useful to <i>perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness</i>, respectively.
    </li>
    <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to Perceived Usefulness and Column G refers to Perceived Ease of Use.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Run Descriptive Statistics</h2>
<aside>
<p>
    <strong> Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <i> perc_enjoy </i> is much higher on average 
    than <i> perc_usefulness </i>, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it</strong>
</p>
</aside>


<p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, 
those with continuous values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the <strong>continuous</strong> 
values of <i>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness,</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> are already adjacent.)Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary,
 making sure not to include variable labels
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Add-Ins</strong>. and make sure <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools > Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics.</strong> Click OK.</li>
        <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. 
Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, <i>Column 1</i> should be <i>perc_enjoy.</i> Your 
Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for <i>perc_usefulness</i> and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i>

  <h2>Run inferential statistics</h2>

  <p>Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. 
    (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW. 
    You can also download a 30-day free trial.)
    <ol>
        <li>When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. 
            Select <b>Open an existing data source > More Files...</b> </li>

        <li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>

        <li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the dataset.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p> The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the Analyze menu in the standard toolbar.</p>

Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and 
tests. Under PASW's <b>Analyze</b> menu, see if you can also find the following:
<ol>

  <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>  

  <li>Simple linear regression</li>

  <li>Non-parametric correlation</li>

</ol>


<figure>
    <img src="datalesson_fig5.png">
    <figcaption> Don't assume PASW doesn't run a given test.Many are located under broader statistical classifications.
        </figcaption>
  </figure> 
<p>
    Use your prior knowledge or the 
    <a href=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm>Choosing the Correct Statistic</a> resource to determine which 
    statistic to run to find whether there is a significant difference in perc_usefulness between free_play and other tutorial types.
</p>

    <p>Consult 
    <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm">UCLA's Choosing the Correct Statistic</a>  to ensure 
    the statistical anlaysis is appropriate for your research question(s), 
    variables of interest, and associated data types.</p> 

<p>You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of  variance is the appropriate test. Go to <b>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</b> 
A new window will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the <i>perc_usefulness</i> variable from the scrollable list on the 
    left, and click the top arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable)</li>

    <li>Select the <i>free_play</i> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it to the Grouping Variable section 
        (independent variable).</li>
    <li>Click <b>Define Range.......</b>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field. This specifies the two categorical variables to be 
    tested. Your screen should now look like Figure 6. Click Continue.</li>
</ol>

    <img src="datalesson_fig6.png" >
    <figcaption>For Kruskal Wallis, an independent (free_play) and a  dependent variable (perc_usefulness) are selected.
</figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>

<p>Click OK to display the statistical analysis results to new viewing window. Your results screen should look like Figure 7. Because statistical analysis
output contains many numerical components (some of which must be cited in  formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the
PASW software. To save the results, go to <strong>File > Export.</strong> Change Document Type
to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
